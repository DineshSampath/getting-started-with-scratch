## Add Sprites

If you feel that the Scratch cat sprite does not suit your needs then you can add other sprites, or even create your own!

- At the top of the Sprites palette are three icons to create a new sprite.
2. The first allows you to **Paint your own sprite**. Click on this and it will open the **Paint Editor** window. Here you can use shapes, lines, and freehand drawings to make fun characters.
3. The second icon allows you to **Choose a new sprite** from those already built into Scratch or saved on your Raspberry Pi. Click on this, and you will be able to navigate to the folders containing those sprites and select one you like.
4. The third icon will, when clicked, give you a **surprise sprite**. Click this and see what happens!

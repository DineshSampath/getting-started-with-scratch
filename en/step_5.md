## Make the Scratch cat move

The cat in the white preview window is an example of a **sprite** in Scratch. Currently the Scratch cat sprite is on a blank **stage**. Let's get the cat to move.

- Click on the Scratch cat sprite.
2. Then click on the blocks palette and select **Control**.
3. Next drag a **When green flag clicked** block and place it on the scripts area in the middle of the screen.
4. Add a blue **Move 10 steps** block from the **Motion** blocks palette and connect it to the **When green flag clicked** block.
5. Now click the green flag icon in the top right hand side of the screen and see the cat move!
6. How would you get the cat to move further?

## Changing the way the sprite looks

All sprites in Scratch can wear different costumes.

- Click on your sprite to select it. In the **Scripts** area in the middle of the screen, click on the **Costumes** tab.
2. You will see that the cat has two costumes. Click on Copy to make a third costume and a new cat costume should appear.
3. Select **costume3** and click on **Edit**. This will open the **Paint Editor**. Experiment with all the buttons and tools to find out what they do.
4. Next, draw some clothes on the costume and click **OK**.
5. To switch between costumes, click on the **Scripts** tag. Add the purple **Looks** block, **Switch to Costume**, to the other blocks and connect it.
6. Select **costume3** from the drop-down menu on the purple block.
7. Now run your program to see the costume change.
